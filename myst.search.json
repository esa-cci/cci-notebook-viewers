Using open climate data from the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI), we will investigate how El Ni√±o manifests in the ocean, affects the land and atmosphere, and leaves its fingerprint across multiple Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). Further, we will try to see how it interacts with broader climate trends. As climate change progresses, scientists are increasingly asking: Is El Ni√±o itself changing?\n\nWe‚Äôll use real-world data to explore not only the signature of El Ni√±o across multiple Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), but also whether climate change is altering its frequency, intensity, or impacts.","type":"content","url":"/external-notebooks/esa-cci/ect-training/lps-vienna-06-2025/lps-intermediate-level-elnino#introduction","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"LPS Training - Intermediate Level: Analyzing Sea Surface Temperature and El Ni√±o in a Changing Climate using ESA CCI Data","lvl3":"Questions We Aim to Explore","lvl2":"Introduction:"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/external-notebooks/esa-cci/ect-training/lps-vienna-06-2025/lps-intermediate-level-elnino#questions-we-aim-to-explore","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"LPS Training - Intermediate Level: Analyzing Sea Surface Temperature and El Ni√±o in a Changing Climate using ESA CCI Data","lvl3":"Questions We Aim to Explore","lvl2":"Introduction:"},"content":"What are the oceanic symptoms of El Ni√±o?\n\nCan we detect the warming of the Pacific Ocean using satellite-derived sea surface temperatures?\n\nHow does El Ni√±o affect sea level, cloud cover, and rainfall?\n\nDo we see changes in the ocean surface height or shifts in the cloud structure?\n\nWhat signals do we find over land?\n\nHow are soil moisture and land surface temperature impacted during El Ni√±o years?\n\nCan we confirm El Ni√±o‚Äôs footprint across multiple climate variables?\n\nDoes the timing and location of anomalies align across oceanic and terrestrial parameters?\n\nHow might climate change be influencing El Ni√±o?\n\nDo we see signs of increased extremes, shifting patterns, or enhanced regional impacts in recent decades?","type":"content","url":"/external-notebooks/esa-cci/ect-training/lps-vienna-06-2025/lps-intermediate-level-elnino#questions-we-aim-to-explore","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"LPS Training - Intermediate Level: Analyzing Sea Surface Temperature and El Ni√±o in a Changing Climate using ESA CCI Data","lvl3":"What You‚Äôll Learn","lvl2":"Introduction:"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/external-notebooks/esa-cci/ect-training/lps-vienna-06-2025/lps-intermediate-level-elnino#what-youll-learn","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"LPS Training - Intermediate Level: Analyzing Sea Surface Temperature and El Ni√±o in a Changing Climate using ESA CCI Data","lvl3":"What You‚Äôll Learn","lvl2":"Introduction:"},"content":"By working through this notebook, you will:\n\nAccess and explore CCI datasets using the ESA Climate Toolbox\n\nCreate regional and temporal subsets of climate variables\n\nVisualize and analyze time series and spatial patterns\n\nCompare strong El Ni√±o events (e.g., 1997, 2015) with neutral or La Ni√±a years\n\nReflect on the potential influence of climate change on El Ni√±o behavior and impacts\n\nOptionally: explore uncertainties in cloud data and other advanced features\n\n","type":"content","url":"/external-notebooks/esa-cci/ect-training/lps-vienna-06-2025/lps-intermediate-level-elnino#what-youll-learn","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"LPS Training - Intermediate Level: Analyzing Sea Surface Temperature and El Ni√±o in a Changing Climate using ESA CCI Data","lvl2":"What is El Ni√±o?"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/external-notebooks/esa-cci/ect-training/lps-vienna-06-2025/lps-intermediate-level-elnino#what-is-el-ni-o","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"LPS Training - Intermediate Level: Analyzing Sea Surface Temperature and El Ni√±o in a Changing Climate using ESA CCI Data","lvl2":"What is El Ni√±o?"},"content":"El Ni√±o is Spanish for ‚Äúthe Christ Child‚Äù and is named after the Christmas season when it typically occurs. During an El Ni√±o event, a mass of warm water is transported by wind circulation from the western to the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe cool, nutrient-rich water - normally present off the western coast of South America, containing large fish populations - is replaced by warm water from the west. This leads to a decline in fish stocks and heavy rainfall due to increased moisture, often resulting in floods. On the other hand, the Australian coast experiences a lack of humidity, causing draughts and wildfires. El Ni√±o is not just an oceanic phenomenon - it affects all spheres. Tracking El Ni√±o via satellite measurements enables us to take precautions and better prepare for its impacts on weather and environment.\n\nIn this Climate from Space story, you can see more information about the most recent El Ni√±o event in 2023 \n\n(Link).\n\nNow, let‚Äôs have a look at the data and how we can identify and analyse such El Ni√±o events ourselves, using the the CCI data portal with the esa_climate_toolbox.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/external-notebooks/esa-cci/ect-training/lps-vienna-06-2025/lps-intermediate-level-elnino#what-is-el-ni-o","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"LPS Training - Intermediate Level: Analyzing Sea Surface Temperature and El Ni√±o in a Changing Climate using ESA CCI Data","lvl2":"Does climate change affect El Ni√±o?"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/external-notebooks/esa-cci/ect-training/lps-vienna-06-2025/lps-intermediate-level-elnino#does-climate-change-affect-el-ni-o","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"LPS Training - Intermediate Level: Analyzing Sea Surface Temperature and El Ni√±o in a Changing Climate using ESA CCI Data","lvl2":"Does climate change affect El Ni√±o?"},"content":"The effect of climate change and rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on El Ni√±o is still not fully understood.

These errors are amplified in challenging conditions, such as areas with variable cloud cover, complex terrain, or mixed land cover types, where accurate retrieval of surface temperatures becomes more difficult. Additionally, the high-resolution nature of the data means more detailed measurements, which can increase the influence of random fluctuations compared to systematic or locally correlated errors.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/external-notebooks/esa-cci/ect-training/lst-leicester-12-2024/lst-training#step-3-contribution-to-total-uncertainty","position":37},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Analyzing Land Surface Temperature and Uncertainties: Insights from ESA CCI Data","lvl4":"Step 4: Temporal Trends in Uncertainties","lvl2":"3.
